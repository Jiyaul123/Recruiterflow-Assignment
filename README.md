## Mock API Limitation

This project uses a **mock API** such as JSONPlaceholder for fetching user data. The `UserService.getAllUsers()` function makes a GET request to this public mock API.

### Limitations:

-   **GET (Read)**: Real API call â€” retrieves a static list of users from the mock API.
    
-   **POST (Add)** and **DELETE (Remove)**:
    
    -   These are **not sent to the server**.
        
    -   All changes (adding or deleting users) are handled **locally using React state**.
        
    -   **Refreshing the page** will reset all changes and reload the original data from the mock API.
        

### Add User

-   Triggered via a modal.
    
-   Adds the new user to the `userData` array in memory.
    

### Delete User

-   Prompts a confirmation modal.
    
-   Removes the user from `userData` in memory.
